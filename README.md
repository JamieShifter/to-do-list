## Step by step

To add new task, simply write it in the top text field and click the submit button "Dodaj zadanie"

To remove an existing task - click the trash icon on the right of task you want to remove

To mark task as done, click the green button next to it, button should change to "✓" and text should now be striked through

To mark task as NOT done, click the green button next to it, button should change to plain and the striketrough should disappear from text

Whenever you decide that you want to mark all tasks as done - use the appropriate button "Ukończ wszystkie"

And if for some reason you decide to hide tasks that are done - use the "Ukryj ukończone", which you can revert any time
